## Dream Journal Overview
Project to create a full stack MERN application. This app is a dream journal style website. There are two models which include Dreams and Goals. The dreams portion allows the user to document dreams they've had and try to figure out how their day prior influenced the dream. The goals section allows the user to add what goals they hope to accomplish, with a section saying when the goal should be completed by. With both models the user is able to create new, edit and delete from a Mongo Database.
