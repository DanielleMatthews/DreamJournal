## Dream Journal Overview
Project to create a full stack MERN application. This application incorporates React.js and RESTful routing with full CRUD for the back-end API portion. This app allows the user to create new, update, and delete from a Mongo database through the backend API. Both the front and back-end have been deployed to Heroku, to access the live site check the links below.

## Description
This journal type application was made for the purpose of tracking dreams and keeping track of goals. There are two models which include Dreams and Goals. The dreams portion allows the user to document dreams they've had and try to figure out how their day prior influenced the dream. The goals section allows the user to add what goals they hope to accomplish, with a section saying when the goal should be completed by. With both models the user is able to create new, edit and delete from a Mongo Database. 


## Future Plans 
I would like to add more styling to the app and add authentication for users to login and have their own section for their own personal dreams and goals.
